# tme- Custom Testing Framework for my apps

## Implementation Plan:
    1. File Collection
    2. Test environment setup
    3. Test file execution
    4. Report results


### File Collection:
    1. Find all files ending in '*.test.js' recursively through a folder
    2. Store a reference to each file we find
    3. After getting a full list of the test files, execute them one by one
